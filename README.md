Walmart Sales Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data using SQL and Python to uncover insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency. The analysis is conducted using MySQL and PostgreSQL, with data manipulation in Pandas and NumPy.

Project Steps

1. Set Up the Environment

Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

Create a structured workspace within VS Code.

Organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

2. Set Up Kaggle API

Steps:

Obtain your Kaggle API token from Kaggle (Profile Settings â†’ Download kaggle.json).

Configure Kaggle by placing the kaggle.json file in your local .kaggle folder.

Use the command:

kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>

to pull datasets directly into your project.

3. Download Walmart Sales Data

Data Source: Kaggle API

Dataset Link: Walmart Sales Dataset (Add actual link)

Save the data in the data/ folder for easy reference and access.

4. Install Required Libraries & Load Data

Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2

Load Data: Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

5. Explore the Data

Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand structure and distribution.

Use functions like:

df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()

Identify missing values, incorrect data types, and potential outliers.

6. Data Cleaning

Remove Duplicates to prevent skewed results.

Handle Missing Values: Drop or fill missing values where necessary.

Fix Data Types: Ensure correct formats (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).

Currency Formatting: Convert string-based currency values to numerical format.

Validation: Perform final checks for consistency.

7. Feature Engineering

Create New Columns:

df['Total_Amount'] = df['unit_price'] * df['quantity']

Enhance Dataset: Adding computed fields to streamline SQL analysis.

8. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL

Database Connection: Use SQLAlchemy to connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Create Tables: Automate table creation and data insertion.

Verification: Run SQL queries to validate data integrity.
